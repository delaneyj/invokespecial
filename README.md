@invokespecial on the Peggy.js Discord says

it's only several hundred lines of code

And then they went on to school me by starting the parser and the first expressions in Go.  This is the conituation of that conversation.  His main example is in Haskell so I'll take some work to not just parse but truely grok what it's doing and why.
